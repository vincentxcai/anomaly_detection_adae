The goal of this project is to detect anomalies in surveillance videos with a network named Adversarial Duo Autoencoders.  The networks are trained and tested on the publicly available UCSD anomaly detection dataset. 

The functions.py file contains functions needed for data preprocessing and evaluation. 

Part 1: Data preprocessing functions

Part 2: Evaluation functions


The main.py file contains the following parts, as well as the functions to define model (The reason for including the model functions in this file is to give a clear view of the model architectures)

Part 1: Data preprocessing

Part 2: Build models

Part 3: Train models 

Part 4: Evaluate performance
